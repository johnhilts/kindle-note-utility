  | The choice of whether to use WITH-SLOTSversus WITH-ACCESSORSis the same as the choice between SLOT-VALUEand an accessor function: low-level code that provides the basic functionality of a class may use SLOT-VALUEor WITH-SLOTSto directly manipulate slots in ways not supported by accessor functions or to explicitly avoid the effects of auxiliary methods that may have been defined on the accessor functions. But you should generally use accessor functions or WITH-ACCESSORSunless you have a specific reason not to.                                                                                          | pcl   |          |     241 |

** just the text
restart-case is a mechanism that allows only imperative transfer of control for its associated restarts. 
restart-case is built on a lower-level mechanism called restart-bind, which does not force transfer of control. 
restart-bind is to restart-case as handler-bind is to handler-case. 
The syntax is (restart-bind ((name function . options)) . body) 
The body is executed in a dynamic context within which the function will be called whenever (invoke-restart ’name) is executed. 
The options are keyword-style and are used to pass information such as that provided with the :report keyword in restart-case.

you generally want to put restarts in the lowest-level code possible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
** What restarts do I want?
*** handle used port for http / ssl
**** options
- Re-try (built-in)
- Use a different port number - default to (incf port-number)
- Is there a way to see if a port is unavailable?
*** handle used port for swank
** condition for port already in use
Socket error in "bind": EADDRINUSE (Address already in use)
   [Condition of type SB-BSD-SOCKETS:ADDRESS-IN-USE-ERROR]
