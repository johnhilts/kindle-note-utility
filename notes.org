  | The choice of whether to use WITH-SLOTSversus WITH-ACCESSORSis the same as the choice between SLOT-VALUEand an accessor function: low-level code that provides the basic functionality of a class may use SLOT-VALUEor WITH-SLOTSto directly manipulate slots in ways not supported by accessor functions or to explicitly avoid the effects of auxiliary methods that may have been defined on the accessor functions.

restart-case is a mechanism that allows only imperative transfer of control for its associated restarts. 
restart-case is built on a lower-level mechanism called restart-bind, which does not force transfer of control. 
restart-bind is to restart-case as handler-bind is to handler-case. 
The syntax is (restart-bind ((name function . options)) . body) 
The body is executed in a dynamic context within which the function will be called whenever (invoke-restart ’name) is executed. 
The options are keyword-style and are used to pass information such as that provided with the :report keyword in restart-case.

you generally want to put restarts in the lowest-level code possible
